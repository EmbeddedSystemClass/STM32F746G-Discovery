I made some modification on the original project.  
The project was converted to Attolic Truestudio IDE.
This project based on HAL library and usig BSP functions.  
Hardware is a stock STM32F746G-DISCOVERY development board from ST Microelectronics.  
This example using FreeRTOS real time operating system.  
The GUI library is STemWin embedded graphical library from Segger.
